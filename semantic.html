        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Growing up as a kid, I was really fascinated by sports in general whether it was volleyball, basketball, 
            or even the amazing game of tennis. But one specifically shined differently from the rest, 
            one that I view as not just a sport but something that helps with my mental health, and that is the beautiful game of football.</p>

        <h2>Details</h2>
        <p>Starting off, I love this sport because of its history, big names like Ricardo Kaka, Steven Gerrard or even the almighty Lionel Messi, 
            growing up, These names really inspired me to do my best in whatever I do, whether thats academics or sports.</p>

        <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
        <p>My dad inspired me a lot to play this sport to the fullest, 
            which is why I am now an international player, representing my country. Without my dad, I wouldn't have the same drive that I do now for this sport, so massive props to him. clap clap!</p>
